    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    Dear Eileen,
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part
    of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    <h1>Starting dates</h1>
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
    could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
    You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our website.
